# Comparative Analysis of Proof of Work and Proof of Stake Consensus Mechanisms from Performance and Energy Efficiency Perspectives

# Results

# 1. Energy Consumption
Simulation indicates:

PoW requires approximately 30–150 million Joules per block.

PoS requires only about 0.2 Joules per block.

Real-world estimates show:

Bitcoin PoW ≈ 120–200 TWh/year

Ethereum PoS ≈ 0.01 TWh/year

→ ≈99.95% energy reduction


# 2. Throughput (TPS)

Mechanism	Throughput

PoW (Bitcoin)	3–7 TPS

PoS (Ethereum)	30–100 TPS

Modern PoS Chains (Solana, Near)	>1,000 TPS


# 3. Finality

PoW: ~60 minutes (Bitcoin 6-block confirmation)

PoS: 2–15 minutes (Ethereum PoS epochs)


# 4. Security

PoW: Highly resistant due to computational cost; 51% attack requires enormous hashing power + energy.

PoS: 51% attack requires acquiring majority stake; misbehavior can be penalized via slashing.


# 5. Analysis

PoW excels in historical security, decentralization, and economic resistance to attacks. However, its energy-intensive nature and scalability limitations hinder modern blockchain applications.

PoS significantly reduces energy usage, improves throughput, and enables flexibility in network design. However, it introduces new concerns such as stake centralization, which may affect decentralization properties.
